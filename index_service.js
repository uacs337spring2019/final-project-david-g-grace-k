Authors: David Gonzales and Grace Kaylor
File: index_service.js
This program acts as the service for our main planner. This program
handles users posting new assignments on the planner and saving them
to a text file using a POST. Assignments are posted with commas separating the content
and a new line is added at the end to make looping easier. The program also retrieves
the assignments from the text file using a GET when the user clicks a button to refresh
their planner. It parses the file on new lines then splits the lines on commas, and
passes back the information in json that is easy to work with.
